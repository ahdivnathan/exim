      "In this notebook, we have a script that scrapes various data pertaining to import and export information for each country from 1995 to 2012, as well as stock index data for a selection of developed nations.  For each country whose import and export data we scrape, we are collecting data on who they import and export from, and the mix of products that they import and export.  For each country whose stock index data we scrape, we pull raw prices of the country's main stock index for the years under investigation.  After scraping the data in the form of Python dictionaries, we conduct some basic scrubbing techniques before storing the relevant information in CSVs for later use.  Furthermore, to demonstrate analysis techniques using numpy, we create the Trade Diversification Index before storing that as our measure of trade diversity. We will be going over the data gathering process of our 4 datasets:\n",
